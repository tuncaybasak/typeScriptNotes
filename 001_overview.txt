## Typescript ##

TypeScript is an open-source object-oriented language developed and maintained by Microsoft.

TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding data types, classes, and other object-oriented features with type-checking. 
It is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

= Why TypeScript =

JavaScript is a dynamic programming language with no type system. JavaScript provides primitive types like string, number, object, etc., 
but it doesn't check assigned values.

The type system increases the code quality, readability and makes it easy to maintain and refactor codebase. 
More importantly, errors can be caught at compile time rather than at runtime.

Hence, the reason to use TypeScript is that it catches errors at compile-time, so that you can fix it before you run code. 
It supports object-oriented programming features like data types, classes, enums, etc.

TypeScript compiles into simple JavaScript.
